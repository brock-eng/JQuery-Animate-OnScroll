# jQuery-Animate-OnScroll
jQuery script that activates animations when an html element is revealed by a users scroll.  Can be set to run on the first scroll reveal or indefinitely.

### Usage
Call <strong>AnimateOnScroll()</strong> within a <strong>$(document).ready function.</strong>  Set the class parameters to your own CSS animation classes.  Set resetOnScrollUp as <strong>true</strong> to reset the animation every time the user scrolls back up your page (i.e. render the animation multiple times versus just once).
